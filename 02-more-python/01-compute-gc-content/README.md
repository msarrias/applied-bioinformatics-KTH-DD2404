## Compute GC Content
## Instructions:
Write a program gccontent for computing GC content for a genome.

## Requirements
Your program must read any number of files from the command line arguments, compute GC for file after file, and write them to standard out in order. All sequences (chromosomes and/or contigs) from a genome should be included in the analysis. You program must be structured so that: one function is in charge of reading a genome sequence, one function is computing the GC content of a sequence.
