## KLEEK aligned
## Instructions:

Note: This assignment is connected to the motif filter assignment.

Determine whether the sequences are conserved enough around the KLEEK motif that its alignment is perfect: the motif sequences are lining up.

Take the test file and retrieve the sequences that contain the KLEEK motif. Use the program 'muscle' to compute a multialignment of the KLEEK sequences. Use the alignment viewer 'seaview' to inspect the alignment. How well do the KLEEK motifs align? Utilizing known sequence features is a good way of ensuring that a multiple sequence alignment is good.

## To present:
Explain the purpose of multialignments! 

> Does the KLEEK motif line up in your multialignment?

There is a lot of variation between the sequences. The KLEEK motif it is indeed lined up in the multialingment. But not in the first sequence, where is not align with the others, this could be due to the length and the program failed to align it with the rest, it could be fixed manually.
