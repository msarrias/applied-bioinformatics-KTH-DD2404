## Reading the Stockholm format
> Explain the general structure of a Stockholm file. What is an "accession"?

Stockholm format is a multiple sequence alignment format used by Pfam and Rfam to disseminate protein and RNA sequence alignments.

Accession number: Accession number in form PFxxxxx (Pfam) or RFxxxxx (Rfam).

An accession number in bioinformatics is a unique identifier given to a DNA or protein sequence record to allow for tracking of different versions of that sequence record and the associated sequence over time in a single data repository. Because of its relative stability, accession numbers can be utilized as foreign keys for referring to a sequence object, but not necessarily to a unique sequence. All sequence information repositories implement the concept of "accession number" but might do so with subtle variations.

Pfam is a database of protein families that includes their annotations and multiple sequence alignments generated using hidden Markov models

Rfam is a database containing information about non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families and other structured RNA elements. It is an annotated, open access database originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with Janelia Farm and currently hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute.Rfam is designed to be similar to the Pfam database for annotating protein families.
